Had an old Bluetooth/iPod dock in the garage but I lost the bluetooth connection to it each time me and my phone went outside. And it didn't get reconnected by itself. Annoying? I thougt so.  
So I took a RaspberryPi Zero W I had laying around, put MoodeAudio on the SD card and started experimenting/googling.

Now I have a SpotifyConnect and Airplay capable player for stupid bluetooth speakers!

### Setup MoodeAudio

### Autoconnect Bluetooth
  - Script
    - chmod
  - Cron job
  - Start cron
